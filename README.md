# Dockerized Python Flask App "Nanoservice"
Tiny one-file app and Docker image. Will use this for "spiking" various deployment strategies.

## TODOs?
0. Add some kind of env var (secret?), so we can spike various config update processes
0. Add some trivial code change in a separate branch, and spike continuous deployment
